# Andrew Perkins Portfolio

Welcome to my Portfolio landing page.

## The Purpose of this Page

The page was developed by me to give a little information about my personal and professional background as well as links to some of my work and contact information.

## About This Page's Structure and Style

This page was designed with a clear page title and navigation links in the header. Three of the navigation links go to the anchor for their respective sections on the page. The fourth link, for Resume, will be linked at a later time. The header is styled with flex so it is responsive to differenct screen sizes.

Immediately below the header is a figure element that displays an image and a subtitle.

Below the figure element is my bio section. It is styled with flex so it is responsive to different screen sizes.

Below my bio is a section featuring images and links to my projects in GitHub. The images display opacity when hovered. The top image (hero) is twice the width and height of the smaller images. For now, I have only linked the hero image to GitHub and will add more links as add more to my portfolio. This section is styled with flex so it is responsive to different screen sizes. For instance, when a browser's max-width is 1235px and below, the hero image resizes to the same as the other images and all images wrap in the column.

Below the section displaying my projects is the footer, which has my contact infomation. All contacts are linked.

## Credits
I leaned on the various class activities studied in Module 2 Advanced CSS to help guide the style of this page. I also utilized a variety of the resources supplied during the lessons, including CSS Tricks, W3 Schools, and MDN Web Docs.
