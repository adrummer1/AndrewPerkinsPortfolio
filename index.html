        <p id="text">After graduating from the University of Kansas with a B.S. in Strategic Communications, I spent the next 23 rewarding years climbing the ranks in the consumer media industry. During my time in publishing, I had the fortune of taking on (and succeeding at) a number of challenges in a rapidly changing field. Most recently, as a senior level manager for a Kansas-based publisher, I led a team responsible for expanding e-commerce and developing world-class consumer events. As a small business owner on the side, I help clients large and small achieve their objectives with solid, affective website development and digital marketing.</p>
